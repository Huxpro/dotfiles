### Adjusting Your Git Configuration!

Although git auth users by their github username/password, the commits are tracked by the email recorded on your local `git config`. Please follow [Why are my commits linked to the wrong user?
](https://help.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user) to change the email:

```sh
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
